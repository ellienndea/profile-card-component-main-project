# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component solution

This is a solution to the [Profile card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

##This is my first frontend mentor challenge. I just wanted to get to know the workflow. 

- #my-process:build every element in html file, then commented out the elements
     and worked on background styles. Then styled each element from top to bottom. Some fine-tuning in the end.
  #built-with: html, css, flexbox,vs-code, chrome dev tools
  #what-i-learned:sizing and positioning of multiple background-images.
